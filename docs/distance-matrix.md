# Designing a Kernel to Evaluate the Distance Matrix

When evaluating the distance matrix for $N$ vectors of length $M$
(where $N \gg M$), the kernel design must effectively utilize thread cooperation to improve
occupancy and performance.

## Problem Decomposition

1. **Matrix Structure**: The distance matrix $D$ is an $N \times N$ matrix where
   each element $D[i][j]$ represents the distance between vector $i$ and vector
   $j$.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The most common distance measure is Euclidean
   distance, calculated as:

   $$
   D[i][j] = \sqrt{\sum\_{k=1}^{M} (x_i[k] - x_j[k])^2}
   $$

3. **Grid and Block Configuration**:

- **Grid**: Each block can compute distances for a subset of vectors, e.g., a
  block could handle $B$ vectors at a time.
- **Threads**: Within each block, threads can cooperatively compute
  distances, with each thread responsible for computing the distance for a
  different pair of vectors.

## Thread Cooperation and Occupancy

- **Shared Memory**: Use shared memory to store a block of vectors, allowing
  threads to access data quickly and reduce global memory accesses.
- **Cooperative Calculation**: Threads within a block can share partial results
  to compute distances in parallel, improving data locality and cache usage.
- **Occupancy**: By carefully managing register and shared memory usage, you can
  maximize occupancy, ensuring that more warps are active concurrently.

## Changing Conditions: $M \gg N$

If $M \gg N$, the approach changes significantly:

1. **Matrix Structure**: The distance matrix remains $N \times N$, but now each
   vector is much longer, which affects memory usage and computation.

2. **Memory Considerations**:

- **Global Memory Access**: High vector lengths mean that memory access
  patterns become critical. Optimize by minimizing access times and using
  shared memory effectively.
- **Thread Blocks**: You might want to design smaller thread blocks to manage
  the larger amount of data per vector, potentially leading to lower
  occupancy.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The computational burden increases due to the
   longer vectors, requiring careful consideration of parallelization to avoid
   performance bottlenecks.

The design of a kernel for evaluating the distance matrix requires careful
consideration of problem decomposition, thread cooperation, and occupancy.

The relationship between $N$ and $M$ significantly influences how the kernel
is structured, particularly in terms of memory management and computation strategies.
