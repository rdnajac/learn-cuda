# CUDA

CUDA is a general-purpose parallel computing platform and programming
model developed by NVIDIA to leverage the massive parallel processing
power of GPUs. CUDA's scalable programming model uses abstractions like
thread group hierarchies, shared memories, and barrier synchronization
to enable fine-grained and coarse-grained parallelism; allowing
programs to automatically scale across various GPU architectures
by adjusting the number of multiprocessors and memory partitions.
